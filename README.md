# Voice-to-Text-Sentiment-Analysis-Project-Documentation
# 🎙️ Voice-to-Text Sentiment Analysis Project

This project converts audio feedback into text using Amazon Transcribe and then analyzes the sentiment of the transcribed text using an XGBoost model deployed on Amazon SageMaker.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains sample audio files and training datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating data preprocessing, model training, and inference.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for various stages of the pipeline.
- `models/`: Saved models and related artifacts.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/koppsrinu/Voice-to-Text-Sentiment-Analysis-Project-Documentation.git
cd Voice-to-Text-Sentiment-Analysis-Project-Documentation

Usage
Transcribe Audio:

Use the transcribe_audio.py script to transcribe audio files using Amazon Transcribe.

bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/transcribe_audio.py --file_path data/sample_audio.mp3
Train the Sentiment Analysis Model:

Utilize the train_model.py script to train the XGBoost model on the provided dataset.

bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/train_model.py --train_data data/train.csv
Perform Sentiment Analysis:

After training, use the predict_sentiment.py script to analyze the sentiment of transcribed text.

bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/predict_sentiment.py --text "Your transcribed text here"
📝 Example
Here's an example of how to transcribe an audio file and analyze its sentiment:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Transcribe the audio file
python scripts/transcribe_audio.py --file_path data/sample_audio.mp3

# The transcribed text will be saved in the 'transcriptions/' directory.

# Analyze the sentiment of the transcribed text
python scripts/predict_sentiment.py --text_file transcriptions/sample_audio.txt
